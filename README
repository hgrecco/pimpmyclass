Pimp My Class
=============

This library provides base classes to enable useful behavior in Python Objects.

The central purpose of the library is to extend python properties to allow:

- get/set logging.
- get/set timing, success and failure stats.
- async locking.
- get/set coercion and conversion.
- value cache
- prevent unnecessary set.
- read once properties

But most importantly, it allows owner specific configurations. Properties are
class attributes, and therefore it is difficult to have a property which is, for
exampled cached, in an object but not cached in another instance of the same class.

The library also provides DictProperties: that is properties that can be accessed by key;
and also methods!

Each capability is isolated in individual classes allowing you to pick only what you need.
